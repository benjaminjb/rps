# RPS logic 

# player 1 and 2 choose their attacks
# flash countdown and fight! (enable/disable that function)
# the match waits until both have entered their choices
# a winner is chosen
# the database is updated

# compare choice
# choice by button or key, slide animate to move

# rock loses paper, rock beats scissors
# paper beats rock, loses scissors
# scissors loses rock, beats paper

# beats = {
#   :scissors => :rock,
#   :paper => :scissors,
#   :rock => :paper
# }

# if p1_move == beats[p2_move]
#   "p1 wins"
# elsif p2_move == beats[p1_move]
#   "p2 wins"
# else
#   "tie"
# end
